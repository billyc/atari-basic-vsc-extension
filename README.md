# Atari FastBasic language support

A very simple extension which enables syntax highlighting for FastBasic files.

- Syntax highlighting for `.bas` and `.fb` filename extensions
- Comments: full-line comments starting with `'` or `.`, and comments after statements using `'`
- All FastBasic statements and functions highlighted

That's about it!
